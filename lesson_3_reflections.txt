When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I were working on a project that had multiple contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For the same reason you wouldn't want an automatic commit; it may not be a logical stopping point.  You may want to branch off into something else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking is used to clone someone else's repository from github into your github repository.  It allows you to get creative with someone else's idea.  Cloning is making a local copy of something that is on github.  Branches are series of commits that build on each other.
