When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I were working on a project that had multiple contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For the same reason you wouldn't want an automatic commit; it may not be a logical stopping point.  You may want to branch off into something else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking is used to clone someone else's repository from github into your github repository.  It allows you to get creative with someone else's idea.  Cloning is making a local copy of something that is on github.  Branches are series of commits that build on each other.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It would be a benefit if you had to be incommunicado for a while.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Without using github, it would require multiple files, enormous memory space, a lot of remembering of which changes you liked and why you made those changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	If you have a new idea that would stand on it's own, but still needs some development, you might make a separate branch, then merge it into master when ready.
